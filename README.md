Intermediate deposit area: CDataframe (Project C)

Our link to the project: https://github.com/S1plet/c_project.git

The aim of the project is to create a CDataframe, which is similar to an Excel spreadsheet. So far, we have completed the first part of the project, which consists of creating the functions for the columns and the functions for the CDataframe itself.
Later, we will need to upgrade these functions.
