C programming project : CDataframe


Our link to the project: https://github.com/S1plet/c_project.git

The aim of the project is to create a CDataframe, which is similar to an Excel spreadsheet. 
So far, we have completed the first part of the project, which consists of creating the functions for the columns and the functions for the CDataframe itself.

To carry out this project, we found it simpler to use live share than to use github, and to have to push each time we made a modification to the code, to then have to put it into our respective codes, etc. 
That's why we decided to use live share, so that we could both modify the code on our own computer and at the same time the one of the partner.
